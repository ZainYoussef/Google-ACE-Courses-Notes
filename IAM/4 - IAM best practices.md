# Cloud IAM Best Practices

1. **Use Projects for Resource Grouping:**
   - Group resources sharing the same trust boundary within projects (e.g., create a project for each department).

2. **Grant Roles to Groups, Not Individuals:**
   - Simplify access management by granting roles to groups, enabling easier updates to group membership instead of altering individual IAM policies.

3. **Utilize Multiple Groups for Control:**
   - Create multiple groups for better control; for instance, have a group for network administrators and subgroups for specific access levels to resources like Cloud Storage buckets.

4. **Exercise Caution with Service Accounts User Role:**
   - Be cautious when granting the service accounts user role, as it provides access to all resources accessible by the service account.

5. **Provide Descriptive Display Names for Service Accounts:**
   - When creating service accounts, use display names that clearly identify their purpose for better tracking and management.

6. **Establish Service Account Key Rotation Policies:**
   - Implement key rotation policies and methods to enhance security and protect service accounts from unauthorized access.

7. **Implement Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (Cloud IAP):**
   - Use Cloud IAP as a security layer to authenticate and authorize users before allowing access to applications or resources, enhancing protection against unauthorized access.

## Additional Tips:

- **Principle of Least Privilege:**
  - Only grant users the permissions necessary for their roles and responsibilities.

- **Regularly Audit Cloud IAM Permissions:**
  - Conduct regular audits to identify incorrectly granted permissions or those no longer needed.

- **Implement Cloud IAM Conditions:**
  - Use conditions to restrict access based on specific criteria (e.g., resources or times of day), adding an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.
