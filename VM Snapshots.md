# Snapshots for Data Backup and Transfer

## Backup and Recovery
Snapshots play a crucial role in the backup and recovery process for Google Cloud resources. By capturing the state of persistent disks at a specific point in time, snapshots enable data protection and facilitate recovery mechanisms.

## Data Migration Between Zones
Snapshots provide a convenient solution for migrating data between different zones within the Google Cloud infrastructure. This capability ensures efficient and reliable data transfer across geographic regions.

### Zone-to-Zone Data
Whether you need to move data from one geographical zone to another, snapshots offer a versatile tool for seamless data migration. This is particularly valuable when optimizing resource distribution across zones.

### Disk Type Transition
Snapshots can be leveraged to transition data between different disk types. For example, you can transfer data from a standard Elastic Compute Engine (ECD) persistent disk to a faster Solid State Drive (SSD) persistent disk using the snapshot functionality.

> Note: Disk snapshots are specifically designed for persistent disks and do not apply to local SSDs.

## Comparison with Images
It's important to distinguish snapshots from images in the Google Cloud ecosystem. While public or custom images are primarily used for creating instances or configuring instance templates, snapshots are specifically tailored for periodic data backup of persistent disks.

Snapshots serve as a reliable mechanism to safeguard your data, offering flexibility in backup strategies and enabling efficient recovery processes.
