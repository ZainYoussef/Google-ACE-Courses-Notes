### Use Cases for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):

1. **Complex Applications and Microservices:**
   - Ideal for applications with multiple microservices or complex deployment requirements.
   - Provides flexibility and control for effective container management and orchestration.

2. **Custom Configurations:**
   - Suitable when extensive customization of the application environment is required.
   - Offers configuration options for networking, load balancing, security policies, and storage.

3. **Advanced Networking and Security:**
   - Appropriate for applications needing advanced networking features.
   - Supports Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks, Network Policies, and Istio for service mesh.

4. **Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Deployments:**
   - Strong choice for building hybrid or multi-cloud deployments.
   - Enables running parts of the application on-premises or across different cloud providers.

### Use Cases for Google App Engine:

1. **Web Applications and APIs:**
   - Great choice for building web applications, APIs, and simple services.
   - Allows developers to focus primarily on writing code without dealing with infrastructure concerns.

2. **Rapid Development and Prototyping:**
   - Ideal for rapid development and prototyping.
   - Simplifies the deployment process, allowing quick testing and iteration of applications.

3. **Startups and Small Teams:**
   - Beneficial for startups and small teams with limited resources for managing infrastructure.
   - Helps get applications to market faster without the need to worry about underlying infrastructure.

4. **Elastic Scaling:**
   - Well-suited for applications with variable levels of traffic.
   - Offers automatic scaling without the need for configuring Kubernetes resources.
