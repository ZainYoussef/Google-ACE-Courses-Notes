1. **Serverless Lightweight Event-Based Service:**
   - Google Cloud Functions is a serverless platform, meaning you don't need to provision or manage servers.
   - It operates based on events, allowing functions to respond to events triggered by various cloud services.

2. **Programming Language Support:**
   - Cloud Functions supports multiple programming languages, including but not limited to Node.js, Python, Go, Java, and more.
   - Developers can write functions in their preferred language.

3. **Triggered by Cloud Storage and Pub/Sub:**
   - Cloud Functions can be triggered by various cloud events, including changes in Cloud Storage (object creation, deletion, etc.) and messages in Pub/Sub.

4. **Asynchronous Compute Solution:**
   - It provides an asynchronous compute model, where functions are executed in response to events rather than being constantly running.

5. **Pay-per-Execution:**
   - With serverless platforms like Cloud Functions, you typically pay per execution. You are billed based on the actual number of times your function runs and the resources consumed during each execution.
