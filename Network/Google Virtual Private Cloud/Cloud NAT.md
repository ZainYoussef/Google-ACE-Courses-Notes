# Cloud NAT in Google Cloud

Cloud NAT is a managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service provided by Google Cloud. This service allows the provisioning of application instances without public IP addresses while enabling controlled and efficient internet access. The primary use case for Cloud NAT is to permit private instances to access the internet for essential tasks like updates, patching, configuration management, and accessing APIs.

## Key Features and Functionality:

1. **Managed NAT Service:** Cloud NAT is a fully managed service, handling the complexities of NAT configuration and maintenance.

2. **Controlled Internet Access:** Enables private instances to access the internet in a controlled and efficient manner.

3. **Outbound Traffic Only:** Cloud NAT focuses on outbound traffic, providing private instances with internet access. It does not implement inbound NAT.

4. **Isolation and Security:** External hosts cannot directly access private instances behind the Cloud NAT gateway. This design choice ensures the isolation and security of VPC networks.

## Use Cases:

- **Private Instance Internet Access:** Cloud NAT allows instances without public IP addresses to access the internet for necessary updates, patches, and configuration management.

- **Accessing APIs:** Private instances can use Cloud NAT to access external APIs securely and efficiently.

## Considerations:

- **No Inbound NAT:** Cloud NAT does not implement inbound NAT, meaning external hosts cannot directly initiate connections to private instances behind the Cloud NAT gateway.

- **Private Google Access:** To allow VM instances with internal IP addresses to communicate with external IP addresses associated with Google APIs and services, enabling private Google access is necessary.

## Private Google Access:

Enabling private Google access is crucial for VM instances with internal IP addresses to communicate with external IP addresses associated with Google APIs and services. For example, if a private VM needs access to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, private Google access must be turned on.

## Example Scenario:

- **A1 - A2 - B2 can access Google APIs and services.**
  
- **B1 cannot access Google APIs because private Google access is turned off.**
