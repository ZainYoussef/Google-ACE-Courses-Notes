Choosing the right load balancer in Google Cloud depends on various factors such as the type of traffic, IPv6 support, and whether you need a global or regional deployment. Here's a guide to help you make the right choice:

**1. Support for IPv6 Clients:**
   - If you require support for IPv6 clients, the following load balancers terminate the IPv6 connection and place the request as an IPv4 connection:
      - HTTP(S) Load Balancing
      - TCP Proxy
      - SSL Proxy

**2. Combining Internal and External Load Balancers:**
   - If you need to combine an internal and an external load balancer for three-tier web services, consider using:
      - HTTP(S) Internal Load Balancer

**3. Global or Regional Deployment:**
   - **Global Load Balancers:** These support both IPv6 and IPv4 connections and are suitable for distributing traffic globally. Choose global load balancers for:
      - HTTP(S) Load Balancing
      - TCP Proxy (no SSL offload)
      - SSL Proxy (SSL offload)

   - **Regional Load Balancers:** These are suitable for specific regions and support all types of traffic. Choose regional load balancers for:
      - Network Load Balancer (target pool for TCP/UDP traffic, backend service for all traffic)
      - Internal Load Balancer (TCP/UDP traffic)
      - Internal HTTPS Load Balancer

**4. Traffic Types:**
   - Consider the specific traffic type you need to balance:
      - HTTP
      - HTTPS
      - SSL
      - TCP
      - UDP

**5. External or Internal:**
   - Choose between external and internal load balancers based on whether your services are public-facing or internal to your network:
      - External Load Balancers: For public-facing services accessible from the internet.
      - Internal Load Balancers: For services that are internal to your network.

**Summary:**
- **IPv6 Support:** HTTP(S) Load Balancing, TCP Proxy, SSL Proxy.
- **Combining Internal and External:** HTTP(S) Internal Load Balancer.
- **Global Deployment:** HTTP(S) Load Balancing, TCP Proxy, SSL Proxy.
- **Regional Deployment:** Network Load Balancer, Internal Load Balancer, Internal HTTPS Load Balancer.
- **Traffic Types:** Consider the specific traffic type (HTTP, HTTPS, SSL, TCP, UDP).
- **External or Internal:** Choose based on whether your services are public or internal.
