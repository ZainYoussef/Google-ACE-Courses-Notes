# Cloud Spanner: Fully Managed Relational Database

**Overview:**
Cloud Spanner is a fully managed, mission-critical relational database service that offers transactional consistency at a global scale, supporting schemas, SQL (ANSI 2011 with extensions), and automatic synchronous replication for high availability.

**Benefits of Cloud Spanner:**
- **Horizontal Scalability:**
  - Scales horizontally by adding more machines to the resource pool, supporting petabytes of data and thousands of concurrent users.

- **Global Availability:**
  - Offers a 99.999% availability SLA and can be deployed across multiple regions for high availability.

- **Strong Consistency:**
  - Guarantees that all reads and writes will see the latest committed data.

- **Schemas and SQL:**
  - Supports ANSI 2011 SQL with extensions, enabling the use of familiar SQL queries to access data.

- **Automatic Synchronous Replication:**
  - Replicates data synchronously across multiple zones, ensuring data availability.

**Use Cases for Cloud Spanner:**
- **Financial Applications:**
  - Suitable for financial applications requiring high availability, strong consistency, and global scalability.

- **Inventory Applications:**
  - Tracks inventory across multiple locations, ensuring up-to-date information.

- **Telecom Applications:**
  - Tracks customer data and usage, ensuring high-quality service provision.

- **Gaming Applications:**
  - Stores game data and state, ensuring availability and consistency.

**When to Use Cloud Spanner:**
- When needing a horizontally scalable, globally available database with strong consistency.
- When requiring a database supporting ANSI 2011 SQL with extensions.

**When Not to Use Cloud Spanner:**
- If scalability, availability, or consistency are not necessary, other databases may be considered, e.g., MySQL for small databases with limited users.

**Migrating to Cloud Spanner:**
- Migrate from MySQL to Cloud Spanner using the Google Cloud Spanner Migration Service.

**Migration Process Overview:**
1. Convert database and schema to match the Spanner schema.
2. Translate MySQL-specific SQL queries.
3. Adjust application code to use Spanner APIs and features.
4. Export data from MySQL to a portable format (e.g., XML).
5. Import data into Spanner using Google Cloud Dataflow for parallel processing.
6. Maintain consistency between databases during migration, leveraging tools like Spanner replicator.
7. Once migration is complete, delete the MySQL database.
