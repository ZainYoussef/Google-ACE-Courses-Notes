- **Strong Consistency:**
  - Guarantees that all reads and writes will see the latest committed data.

- **Schemas and SQL:**
  - Supports ANSI 2011 SQL with extensions, enabling the use of familiar SQL queries to access data.

- **Automatic Synchronous Replication:**
  - Replicates data synchronously across multiple zones, ensuring data availability.

**Migrating to Cloud Spanner:**
- Migrate from MySQL to Cloud Spanner using the Google Cloud Spanner Migration Service.

**Migration Process Overview:**
1. Convert database and schema to match the Spanner schema.
2. Translate MySQL-specific SQL queries.
3. Adjust application code to use Spanner APIs and features.
4. Export data from MySQL to a portable format (e.g., XML).
5. Import data into Spanner using Google Cloud Dataflow for parallel processing.
6. Maintain consistency between databases during migration, leveraging tools like Spanner replicator.
7. Once migration is complete, delete the MySQL database.
